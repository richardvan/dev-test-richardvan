# dev-test Solution
Hello IFN Representative!

My solution is at this website:

https://safe-inlet-32193.herokuapp.com/

This project was built using [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templates that takes the current location of the browser, hits the /stream endpoint, displays the images as thumbnails (e.g. 2 or 3 per row)

My solution is in my own public repository since the IFN repositories were deleted, thus I couldn't submit a pull request as originally requested.

Cheers!
